You will also have a certain number of points, each time you guess wrong, one point will be deducted. The larger your remaining points, the higher your rank will be, and of course when the points return to 0, you will lose immediately (you're just a chicken bro!). The game will have 3 difficulties for you to challenge yourself. Anyway, good luck and wish you a relaxing experience!\n";
